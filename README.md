## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ ##
My name is Elias Germoliato and I am a Brazilian who has been working in the technology field since 2020. Currently, I am studying Science and Technology and I am about to start the Computer Science course. My passion for technology started when I was studying mechatronics and automation, which led me to work with embedded software development using Java. However, I found my true passion in web development and user interface design. 

Helping people solve their problems through software development is what drives me.
